## Features

- Real-time monitoring of patient health indicators

- Secure data transmission and storage

- Customizable thresholds and alerts for abnormal readings

- Data visualization and analytics

- Patient profile management

- User-friendly web interface

## Hardware Components

The following hardware components are used in this system:

- DHT11 and LM35 Sensors: These sensors are used to measure temperature and humidity levels of the patients.

- ESP8266 Module: This module is used for establishing the IoT connectivity and transmitting the collected data to the server.

- NodeMCU: NodeMCU is an open-source development board based on ESP8266, which is used to interface with the sensors and transmit the data.

- Arduino: Arduino is a microcontroller board used to control and interface with various components, such as the pulse sensor.

- Pulse Sensor: The pulse sensor is used to measure the heart rate of the patients.
